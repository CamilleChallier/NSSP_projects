## Projects for the course Neural Signal and Signal Processing
NX-421 / 6 credits

Teacher(s): Micera Silvestro, Van De Ville Dimitri Nestor Alice

Language: English

### Summary
Understanding, processing, and analysis of signals and images obtained from the central and peripheral nervous system

###  Content
Understanding neural signals obtained by electrophysiology and imaging techniques requires knowledge both about their origin and the measurement process. This course will introduce the properties of a wide range of neural signals that are used to study the brain in health and disease. The relevance of these signals for applications in fundamental and clinical neuroscience will be made clear. In addition, a broad range of signal processing tools and their implementations will be presented with the specific focus to implement and tailor analysis of these signals, which typically comes as large, noisy, but richly structured datasets. Exercises and lab exercises will provide insights into the analysis of imaging data and electrophysiological neural signals.
